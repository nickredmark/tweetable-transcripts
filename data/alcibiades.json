      "The\ncause of my silence has been that I was hindered by a power more\nthan human, of which I will some day explain to you the nature; this\nimpediment has now been removed; I therefore here present myself before\nyou, and I greatly hope that no similar hindrance will again occur.",
      "Meanwhile, I have observed that your pride has been too much for the\npride of your admirers; they were numerous and high-spirited, but they\nhave all run away, overpowered by your superior force of character; not\none of them remains.",
      "And I want you to understand the reason why you\nhave been too much for them. You think that you have no need of them\nor of any other man, for you have great possessions and lack nothing,\nbeginning with the body, and ending with the soul.",
      "In the first\nplace, you say to yourself that you are the fairest and tallest of the\ncitizens, and this every one who has eyes may see to be true;",
      "in the\nsecond place, that you are among the noblest of them, highly connected\nboth on the father's and the mother's side, and sprung from one of the\nmost distinguished families in your own state, which is the greatest in\nHellas,",
      "and having many friends and kinsmen of the best sort, who can\nassist you when in need;",
      "and there is one potent relative, who is more\nto you than all the rest, Pericles the son of Xanthippus, whom your\nfather left guardian of you, and of your brother, and who can do as he\npleases not only in this city, but in all Hellas, and among many and\nmighty barbarous nations.",
      "Moreover, you are rich; but I must say that\nyou value yourself least of all upon your possessions. And all these\nthings have lifted you up; you have overcome your lovers, and they have\nacknowledged that you were too much for them. Have you not remarked\ntheir absence?",

      "For, as you hope to prove your own great value to the state, and having\nproved it, to attain at once to absolute power, so do I indulge a hope\nthat I shall be the supreme power over you, if I am able to prove my own\ngreat value to you, and to show you that neither guardian,",
      "nor kinsman,\nnor any one is able to deliver into your hands the power which you\ndesire, but I only, God being my helper.",

      "And at fourteen years of age he is handed over to the royal\nschoolmasters, as they are termed: these are four chosen men, reputed to\nbe the best among the Persians of a certain age;",

      "I might enlarge on the nurture and\neducation of your rivals, but that would be tedious; and what I have\nsaid is a sufficient sample of what remains to be said.",

      "or if you look at the temperance and orderliness and ease\nand grace and magnanimity and courage and endurance and love of toil\nand desire of glory and ambition of the Lacedaemonians--in all these\nrespects you will see that you are but a child in comparison of them.",
      "Even in the matter of wealth, if you value yourself upon that, I must\nreveal to you how you stand; for if you form an estimate of the wealth\nof the Lacedaemonians, you will see that our possessions fall far short\nof theirs.",
      "For no one here can compete with them either in the extent\nand fertility of their own and the Messenian territory, or in the number\nof their slaves, and especially of the Helots, or of their horses, or of\nthe animals which feed on the Messenian pastures.",
      "But I have said enough\nof this: and as to gold and silver, there is more of them in Lacedaemon\nthan in all the rest of Hellas, for during many generations gold has\nbeen always flowing in to them from the whole Hellenic world, and often\nfrom the barbarian also,",

      "Yet\nthe Spartan wealth, though great in comparison of the wealth of the\nother Hellenes, is as nothing in comparison of that of the Persians and\ntheir kings.",
      "Why, I have been informed by a credible person who went up\nto the king (at Susa), that he passed through a large tract of excellent\nland, extending for nearly a day's journey, which the people of the\ncountry called the queen's girdle, and another, which they called her\nveil;",
      "and several other fair and fertile districts, which were reserved\nfor the adornment of the queen, and are named after her several\nhabiliments.",

      "' And if she heard that this Alcibiades who\nis making the attempt is not as yet twenty years old, and is wholly\nuneducated, and when his lover tells him that he ought to get education\nand training first, and then go and fight the king, he refuses,",
      "and says\nthat he is well enough as he is, would she not be amazed, and ask 'On\nwhat, then, does the youth rely?",
      "' And if we replied: He relies on his\nbeauty, and stature, and birth, and mental endowments, she would think\nthat we were mad, Alcibiades, when she compared the advantages which you\npossess with those of her own people.",
      "And I believe that even Lampido,\nthe daughter of Leotychides, the wife of Archidamus and mother of Agis,\nall of whom were kings, would have the same feeling; if, in your present\nuneducated state, you were to turn your thoughts against her son, she\ntoo would be equally astonished.",
      "But how disgraceful, that we should not\nhave as high a notion of what is required in us as our enemies'\nwives and mothers have of the qualities which are required in their\nassailants! O my friend, be persuaded by me, and hear the Delphian\ninscription,",
      "'Know thyself'--not the men whom you think, but these kings\nare our rivals, and we can only overcome them by pains and skill.",
